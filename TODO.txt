  - oscillator sync
  - the misc section
  - split and multi-timbral
- wavetable synth not quite ok yet, needs work
  - what are wave parameters used for? wave.SEMI, wave.FINE
- implement the missing MIDI mod sources
- respond to pitchbend messages, CC, and SysEx
- adjust all rate values everywhere
- fixed point math (maybe... for speed and lo-fi effect)
  - see util/math/fp.d initial implementation
- VST plugin for the other platforms

gui
- everything

------

problems (D compiler)
- gdc frontend fails because too old
- ldc compilation error with stack trace and no info
  - related to using tkd, it's all I know
  - before using tkd, it was impossible to compile unless in release mode (same kind of error)
- dmd requires linking with libsamplerate, even if never used (GPL library only used in testing)
  - does not accept pragma lib, others do
  - forced linking in dub.json

problem (D build)
- cannot choose which compiler in DUB, need to install the desired compiler and remove others
